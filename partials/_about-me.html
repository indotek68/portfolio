			<p>I am a former architectural designer, current web developer, and have a passion for design.</p>
			
			<p>I have a Bachelors degree in Environmental Design with an emphasis in Architectural Design. My work has ranged from residential and interior commercial architecture to educational facilities and hospitals. I have also built several web applications in Javascript, Angular, Node, Ruby, Rails and iPhone app in Ionic.</p>

			<p>My UX skills include rapid prototyping, user research, visual design and interaction design.</p>

			<p>My Environmental Design degree challenged me to solve problems for the built environment through learned design principles. Learning UX helped me translate & apply my approach to design based solutions in architecture to the web & native environments. Now, a developer, I design & code simultaneously always considering an end users' needs and perspective.</p>
